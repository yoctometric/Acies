# Acies
A sound game for kids where a point will follow a line until it
hits a corner. Upon hitting the corner, the game will make a sound and then the point will
proceed down the intersecting line. The pitch, volume, and quality of the sound created depends
on the color, width, and how dotted the line is. Users will be able to create their own music by
drawing lines in an arrangement to create a melody or rhythm.
